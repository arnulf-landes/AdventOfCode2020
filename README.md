# Advent of Code 2020 #
This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I prefer transforming the input data to my needs to make it easier to work with and I'll provide the regular expressions I used in text files (`dayXX/input_transform_regex.txt`).

I will include both the original input files from the puzzle and my transformed/prepared versions.

Let's see whether I can solve (and post) all puzzles or if I get lazy...
