# Advent of Code 2020 #

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Please keep in mind that I do *not* aim for high readability. I will use lots of array manipulation, arrow functions and features from the latest ECMAScript Edition. I'll also take advantage of Javascript's implicit type coercion.

Let's see whether I can solve all puzzles *and* also keep this repo up-to-date or if I get lazy near the end...
