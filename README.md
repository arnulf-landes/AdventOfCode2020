# Advent of Code 2020 #

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I usually prefer transforming the input data to my needs (e.g. with the help of a few regular expressions) to make it easier to work with. The regular expressions will be provided as text files (`dayXX/input_transform_regex.txt`).

I will include both the original input file (`dayXX/input.txt`) from the puzzle *and* my transformed/prepared version (`dayXX/input_transformed.xyz`).

Please keep in mind that I do *not* aim for high readability. I will try to answer questions though, so feel free to [create an issue](../../issues) if you're curious about something.

Let's see whether I can solve (and post) all puzzles or if I get lazy near the end...
